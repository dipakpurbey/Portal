## Issue

1. Check that the issue has not already been reported ([search here](https://github.com/promisasu/Portal/issues)).
2. Document the steps that were followed that resulted in an error.
3. Document any error messages that were printed in the console.
4. Ensure any error messages or code snippets are noted with a [fenced code block](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks).
5. Screenshots for UI errors are helpful.

## Pull Request

   * Tests can be run locally using `npm lint test`
   * Disabling tests is not fixing them
