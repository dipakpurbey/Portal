                Check internet connectivity. If the user is connected to the internet and the error persists, ask the
                user to double check whether correct url for the server has been entered. If the error persists, check
                server logs to see if the request actually came through.

                The user has landed on the survey page but the app doesn’t have the questions. This should never happen,
                but if it happens, the cause is that the request to “get_survey” didn’t complete properly.
